# Data-Analysis-Project-with-SQLite

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing three distinct data analysis projects, each harnessing the power of SQLite to uncover valuable insights from different datasets. Here, I provide an overview of each project:

**1. Analyzing The Chicago City Socio-economic Dataset with SQLite:**

In this project, I delved into the Chicago City Socio-economic Dataset, leveraging SQLite for data analysis. My journey commenced with data retrieval using SQLite queries to extract relevant information. Subsequently, I utilized SQLite to further process and visualize the data. This project focuses on exploring various socio-economic factors within the city of Chicago, shedding light on key trends, disparities, and patterns that can inform policy decisions and community initiatives.

**2. Analyzing the Chicago Public Schools Dataset for the 2011-2012 Year with SQLite:**

The Chicago Public Schools Dataset for the 2011-2012 year contains extensive school-level performance data, which serves as the basis for school report cards. For this project, I employed SQLite to analyze this dataset comprehensively. SQLite queries facilitated data extraction and organization, while I used SQLite for conducting in-depth analysis and visualization. Through this project, I aimed to provide valuable insights into school performance, aiding educators, policymakers, and parents in making informed decisions to enhance educational outcomes.
